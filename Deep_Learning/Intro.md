### Perceptron 
- You have some inputs , which are mulitplied by a corresponding weight , after that we 'll add all the results then add a bias to it and pass it to a non linear funtion to get the output.

- Now we apply linear algebra here , make all our inputs as X matrix and Weights are W matrix , then we do dot product X and W add bias and pass to non linear function
- Sigmoid function is an example of such non linear function. Hyperbolic tangent , rectified Linear unit areother examples. These are also called activation function.
- We need non linearity because real world data is heavily non linear
