# Neural Network from Scratch (Python + NumPy)

Build + train a feedforward **neural network from first principles**â€”no TensorFlow/PyTorch abstractions.
I implemented forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent manually to deeply understand the math and mechanics.

> ðŸŽ¯ **Why this repo?** It demonstrates low-level mastery of neural nets (derivatives, chain rule, vectorization) and clean engineering (modular code, plots, reproducibility).

## âœ¨ Features
- Pure **Python + NumPy** implementation (no high-level DL frameworks)
- Configurable architecture: layers, activations, learning rate, batch size, epochs
- Vectorized **forward & backward** passes
- Loss/accuracy tracking and **training curves**
- Clean project layout for quick reading
