A simple yet powerful **Neural Network built from scratch** in Python without any ML libraries.  
Trained on MNIST, demonstrates forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates with raw math only.  

Build + train a feedforward **neural network from first principles** â€” no TensorFlow/PyTorch abstractions.  
I implemented forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent manually to deeply understand the math and mechanics.

>  **Why this repo?**  
> It demonstrates low-level mastery of neural nets (derivatives, chain rule, vectorization) and clean engineering (modular code, plots, reproducibility).


##  Features
- Pure **Python + NumPy** implementation (no high-level DL frameworks)
- Configurable architecture: layers, activations, learning rate, batch size, epochs
- Vectorized **forward & backward** passes
- Loss/accuracy tracking and **training curves**
- Clean project layout for quick reading
