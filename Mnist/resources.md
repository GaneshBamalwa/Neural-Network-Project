# ðŸ“š Resources

These are the key learning materials I used while building this project.  
Both playlists go step by step into the math and coding of neural networks **from scratch**.

## ðŸŽ¥ YouTube Playlists

1. **[VizVura (Vizuara) â€” Neural Networks Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTV0NXA_ZSj6tNyn_UadmUeU3Q3oR-hu)**  
   A structured breakdown of neural network fundamentals, activation functions, and training loops.  
   Great for building intuition with step-by-step math explanations.

2. **[Sentdex â€” Neural Networks from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3)**  
   A practical, code-focused series that complements the math by showing full Python + NumPy implementations.

âœ¨ Both series were instrumental in helping me understand **forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient descent, and vectorization** in depth.
